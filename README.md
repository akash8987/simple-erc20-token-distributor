# Simple ERC-20 Token Distributor

This repository contains a professional-grade Solidity smart contract for an ERC-20 token and a distribution script. It is designed for developers looking to understand how to mint supply and efficiently send tokens to multiple users (Airdrops) while minimizing gas costs.

## Features
* **ERC-20 Compliant**: Fully compatible with MetaMask, Uniswap, and Etherscan.
* **Batch Transfers**: Save gas by sending tokens to multiple recipients in one go.
* **OpenZeppelin Standards**: Built using industry-standard security patterns.

## Quick Start
1. Copy `Token.sol` into [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org).
2. Compile using Solidity 0.8.20.
3. Deploy to any EVM chain (Ethereum, Polygon, Base).
4. Use the `multiSend` function to distribute your tokens.
